# SillyDelay
A simple Delay VST plugin with Dry/Wet, Delay Time and Feedback settings.

Uses the vst crate.

If you'd like to try it out, you can either download the SillyDelay.vst.zip for Mac, or use cargo build --release and get the .dll from the target/release folder in Windows.

There are some issues with it and it does glitch a bit so I don't actually recommend actually using it.
