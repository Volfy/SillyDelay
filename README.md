# SillyDelay
A simple Delay VST plugin with Dry/Wet, Delay Time and Feedback settings.

Uses the vst crate. Feel free to try it out by running cargo build and using the .dll in target/release for Windows. 
On Mac, you can run cargo build and then run a script available from the vst crate to convert the .dylib in target/release to a .vst and placing it in the VST folder.

There are some issues with it and it does glitch a bit so I don't actually recommend actually using it.
